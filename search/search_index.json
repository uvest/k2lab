It is often described as \"the feeling of being in control, of being the source of ones thoughts, actions and their consequences.\" And equivalent to many feelings, we mostly don't notice Agency when we think, move or interact.</p> <p>One well-known model about the source of this feeling of being in control is the comparator-model. This model works on the assumption that we constantly make predictions about our body and our world around us. Especially when we act, we feed a copy of the efferece signal (which we send to our muscles to move them) into a feed-forward model. This feed-forward model then predicts not only the outcome of this action, the resulting state, but also the corresponding sensory consequences: When I touch the hot oven, it will hurt.  This predicted sensory consequence is then compared to what we actually sense. If they match, we feel Agency and everything goes as expected.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Agency/#the-mario-cart-effect","title":"The Mario-Cart Effect","text":"<p>Think of the first time you played Mario Cart with some other people - potentially your friends. It might have happened that you thought you were performing pretty well. You might be a natural at this!  Then you realised that while you were watching Luigi in the upper right corner leading the crowd, poor Yoshi in the bottom left was somehow running into a wall all the time. Wait. Didn't you choose Yoshi? </p> <p>We can observe a few known and intuitive characteristics of Agency in this example: * Expectation matters: Our predictions - based on our known models of the physical world - set the anchor point for our expectations. And expectations are what we measure the observed results against. Expectations are, however, not dependent solely on the outer physical world. They might be biased, e.g. with the: * Performance bias: We tend to rather attribute preferrable outcomes to our actions than such which are bad for us. * ...</p>"},{"location":"blog/Causality_SSD_and_Choice-History/","title":"Trial-history and Choice-history effects on causality perception in schizophrenia","text":"<p><code>status: submitting</code>  Find the pre-print at https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/8ghab</p> <p>tf;dr  We use Michotte Launching events to study the judgements of perceptual causality in healthy controls and schizophrenic patients.  I used a fancy linear regression (GLMM) for looking at the influence of the last launching event and the choice that was made on the current choice.  The last choice indeed influences our perception of causality, both, in an easy to grasp direct way and by modulating the influence of other factors.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Causality_SSD_and_Choice-History/#introduction-and-experiment","title":"Introduction and Experiment","text":"<p>My friends and I have somewhat built up a tradition over the last years. Before christmas, we all dress up in the fanciest suits we can find in our cupboards, attach a vintage bow tie, have a Gl\u00fchwein on the christmas market and head for the the casino. Some of us winning, most of us loosing, but all feeling fancy.  What caught my eye on one of those evenings was the betting behaviour at the Roulette tables. Many bet on either black or red (both having on average a 48.6 % chance). Sometimes, a table spat out the same colour again and again, all black for the last 10, 15, 20 draws. Such is chance. Funnily however, if such sequences occur, more and more people are drawn to the opposite color. They are clearly influenced by the past outcomes of the gamble although there is no information in it - unless some trick is at work. Such is human nature.</p> <p>Now, in our project in the course of TAM we did not go gambling. That is nothing you should do with tax money is it? Instead we looked at perceptual decision making or rather at the perception of causality. So, why telling you about my - seldomly successful - adventures at the casino?</p> <p>For this project, I revisited an experiment conducted by Benjamin Straube and colleagues from the TNM-Lab at the Philipps-University Marburg. They showed their participants a launching event of a blue ball \"colliding\" with a red ball and asked them whether they perceived the event as causal (the blue ball did cause the red ball to move) or non-causal.</p> <p>The following little movieclip, generated by my colleague Yunyan Duan, gives you an impression of such a launching event:</p> <p>The experiment was conducted on patients with Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD) and healthy control (HC) participants. It allows some insights into the differences between SSDs and HCs in the usage of temporal and spatial offset (delay and angle) when perceiving causality.  We were now wondering, if there also were other factors that are used differently between SSDs and HCs. And there my casino story comes into play. I was thinking that there might be a bias given the recent history of observed events. Especially, we were curious about the effect of the last choice.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Multisensory_balance/","title":"Multisensory integration for control","text":"<p>We humans can rely on mutliple senses when moving and acting in our environment. We can even focus on one sense, blend out others, trust or distrust them, or rely on just a subset of them. And most intriguingly, we do so without much mental effort. This skill becomes especially important when our senses don't match up anymore.  One situation where this seamless integration breaks, at least for a few moments, is the visuomotor \"moving room illusion\". Imagine yourself sitting inside a train at a trainstation, looking out of the window at another train (trainception). What happens when that other train starts moving? Most likely you will briefly think that it is your train that (finally) started moving.</p> <p>A more artificial version of a literally moving room was already used in experiments in the 70s showing that people rely heavily on their visual input for keeping balance. This visual dominance also causes us problems, when the visual information is incongruent with information from our proprioceptive and vestibular system.</p> <p>While I won't ask why we have this visual dominance in the first place, I wonder how we robustly integrate vision and other senses when they disagree with each other. How do we detect who is lying?</p>"},{"location":"blog/Multisensory_balance/#what-humans-do","title":"What humans do","text":"<p>As a baseline, we collected some data from human participants doing a simple balancing task while experiencing external-optical flow in their full visual field: Wearing a VR headset, all they saw was moved to one side!  And, loo and behold, that actually does influence their stability! Especially for linear movements, we saw that at the onset of movement people followed the visually perceived movement with their head, before realising their offset and restabilizing themselves.</p> <p>Have a look at the left side of my little poster here:</p>"},{"location":"blog/Multisensory_balance/#what-optimal-control-can-do","title":"What optimal control can do","text":"<p>To explain the susceptibility but also the robustness to optical flow with some maths, we turned to a Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) regulator, an optimal control model, that we set up for controlling an inverted pendulum to stand upright. As you might guess, we use that inverted pendulum as a very crude approimation of a human standing.</p> <p>The magic we added was in the combination and adaptation of the state estimates that we got from a proprioceptive and a visual input stream.  The combination we made dependent on the estimated noise of each stream: The less reliable an input stream was estimated to be, the less weight was placed on it.  And these noise variance estimates we then adapted over time, depending on if a predicted observation matched with the actual observation of each stream. (See right side of the poster above.)</p> <p>Here, we can also strike a link to Agency. A famous model for the Sense of Agency - at least in the sensorimotor context - is the comparator model. If what we expect to observe/ sense/ perceive based on an acion we made fits with what we actually observe/ sense/ perceive, we feel agency about the result. If not, well, then we don't. Here we use this same idea to update our noise estimates and shift the weighting between different input streams: If we feel no Agency about the results in one input stream, we increase its estimated noise. If we do, we decrease the estimated noise.</p>"},{"location":"blog/Multisensory_balance/#what-deep-reinforcement-learning-might-do","title":"What Deep Reinforcement Learning might do","text":"<p>Now, we finally reached what we are still actively working on. </p> <p>One first step has been taken by a student of Max and me who tried to replicate this phenomenon of human visuomotor control in a reinforcement learning agent. </p>"}]}
